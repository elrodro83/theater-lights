theater-lights
==============

Using [XBMC](http://xbmc.org/) and the [cinema-experience add-on](http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=Add-on:Cinema_Experience), take your movie-watching experience to the next level by automatically setting the lights level during the different stages of the CE script run. Dim the lights when the trailers start, and turn them off completely for the feature presentation.
